## Emote Catalog System Implementation Summary

The dynamic emote catalog system for the Highrise bot has been successfully implemented with the following features:

### Core Functionality:

- **Automatic Emote Fetching**: The bot now automatically fetches all available emotes from the Highrise API
- **Emote Categorization**: Emotes are categorized as either free or premium based on their price
- **Persistence**: The emote catalog is saved to disk for future use, reducing API calls
- **Graceful Fallback**: If the API call fails, the system falls back to a previously saved catalog or manual emote list
- **Comprehensive Pattern Recognition**: Enhanced detection of all emote types including sit-, hcc-, fishing-, mining-, etc.
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Automatically removes duplicate emotes from the catalog
- **Improved Search**: Searches through both emote IDs and full item names for better matches

### User Commands:

- `!emotes` or `!allemo`: Lists all available emotes with pagination
- `!emotes free`: Shows only free emotes
- `!emotes premium`: Shows only premium emotes
- `!emotes search <term>`: Built-in search functionality directly in the emotes command
- `!search <term>`: Searches the catalog for emotes matching the given name
- `!refresh`: Allows VIPs to manually refresh the emote catalog (fetches latest data)
- `!refresh status`: Check the current status of the emote catalog without refreshingystem Implementation Summary

- `!refresh`: Allows VIPs to manually refresh the emote catalog (fetches latest data)

### Technical Implementation:

1. Enhanced `emote_catalog.py` module that handles:

   - Fetching emotes via Highrise API with batch processing
   - Categorizing emotes as free or premium
   - Saving/loading the catalog to/from disk
   - Pagination and filtering for display
   - Extensive emote pattern recognition for all emote types
   - Duplicate detection and removal
   - Comprehensive fallback mechanism

2. Added dedicated `emotes.py` command handler with:

   - Category filtering (free/premium)
   - Pagination support
   - Integrated search capabilities

3. Enhanced `search.py` with improved matching algorithm:

   - Searches through emote IDs and full item names
   - Groups results by emote type and category
   - Includes helpful usage instructions

4. Added `refresh.py` for admin/VIP operations:

   - Manual catalog refresh
   - Status reporting with statistics
   - Error handling and fallback procedures

5. Configured automatic initialization on bot startup

6. Added VIP command to refresh the catalog manually

7. Updated README with documentation for the new features

### Benefits:

- Always up-to-date emote list
- Better user experience with categorization
- Easier to find specific emotes through search
- More maintainable than hardcoded lists
- Reduced API calls through persistence

### Future Improvements:

- Add more detailed categorization (dances, emojis, etc.)
- Implement user favorites system
- Add trending or popularity metrics
- Create visual menu for emote selection
